:modelMatrix:
  - will apply all transformations relative to the Mesh. If we scale, rotate
or move the Mesh, these transformations will be contained in the modelMatrix
and applied to the position.

:viewMatrix:
  - will apply transformations relative to the camera. If we rotate the camera
to the left, the vertices should be on the right. If we move the camera in
direction of the Mesh, the vertices should get bigger, etc.

:projectionMatrix:
  - will finally transform our coordinates into the final clip space coordinates.
